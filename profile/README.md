**DentallApp** is a web application with chatbot for appointment management, reminders and sending appointment cancellation messages for the dental office called [World Dental CO](https://www.tiktok.com/@worlddentalco)

This application was actually a degree project which can be found <a href="http://repositorio.ug.edu.ec/handle/redug/65127">here</a> or you can also download the pdf [here](https://github.com/DentallApp/.github/blob/master/degree_project.pdf) (only available in spanish).

## Why was this project created?

This application was developed as a degree project for the [University of Guayaquil](https://www.ug.edu.ec), however, it is not ready to run in a production environment. All requirements for this project were obtained through interviews with the owner dentist of [World Dental CO](https://www.facebook.com/worlddentalco).

In the end, this project was never deployed in that dental office for personal reasons of the authors. However, it was decided to publish the source code of this application so that the community can use it for learning purposes (learn from it or even improve it).
